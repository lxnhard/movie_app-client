# Watch-Til-Death (Movie app: client side)
This repository contains the client side for my web application Watch-Til-Death, built with React. The web
application uses the MERN stack to provide users with access to information about different
movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to sign up, update their
personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
